# Theme Collection
Aimed to be as striaght forward as possible to customize yourself.
I've designed all these themes to work with the standard `root.css` file so people can just change the colors as they wish.
### Adding CSS to Browsers
You can use a browser extension like [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/styl-us/), here's their [homepage](https://add0n.com/stylus.html).
### Firefox Theme
The `manifest.json` file is the only thing related to the theme in Firefox that matches the `root.css`. You can load this file into Firefox without uploading it to the store
using the `about:debugging` url. My theme is available [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/poeko-theme/), however if you use a custom css root and don't want
to use the `about:debugging` url every time Firefox boots you'll have to upload your `manifest.json` as a `.zip` to Firefox store.
